There are four functions in total, two focus on the process of rotating bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer to the left and right places. Another explores the implementation of a function that chooses the bits from y where x has bits set to 1 and bits in z where x has bits set to 0.\n",

    "### Why this Approach?\n",
    "There's several reasons really. The square root of any prime number is irrational in nature. This means it cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers. What this does is it ensures the bits that result from it have no simple predictable pattern.\n",
    "Another reason is distribution, the binary digits of these numbers distribute evenly, meaning that roughly each 0 and 1 occur equally. There's just enough variance in their probability to avoid obvious patterns forming. On a simpler side, independence plays a reason to use them. The bits we get from different square roots of prime numbers show no correlation between each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "calculating the first 32 bits like we are in this task has several practical uses of benefit I think. We could use them for getting values for generating random numbers or for ID creation, where our IDs wouldn't have any patterns that were obvious, keeping them secure. Complementary to what we explored in task 2, we could make use of this for crafting our own hash functions for cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of SHA-256, this approach is used in other algorithms for a similar cryptographic task. SHA-1 at one point used specific constants, but later on it moved to the square/cube root method seen here. MD5 uses similar but with sine functions instead. ChaCha uses select initial words from an ASCII string (expand 32-byte k\").\n",

    "This task is an approximation of the \"Proof of Work\" mechanism. We can see this used in cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. Its used often to [decide who gets to add the next block to a blockchain](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It aids in distribution, providing a way to divide and seperate out who gets coins fairly. Its also a security feature, it makes attempts at network attacks expensive to do. There's several things to consider when doing this task that I mentioned in previous ones that make this a difficult process in my opinion. The Avalache Effect plays into this, where its rone to completely different hash output if even the tiniest changes are made to the input. The Even Distributions play into this too, where we have roughly 50% zeros and 50% ones. Lastly is that this is kind of one-way function. Calculating the hash from the input data isn't terribly difficult, but its far more difficult to find the input when you only have the hash."

    "## Computation with Turing\n",
    "The concept of the Turing machine originates from the 1936 paper [\"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.\"](https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230) This relates back to David Hilbert who posed the question: Is there an algorithm that can determine whether a given maths statement is provable? This was Turings answer to that. The machine he created was simple at first glance, surprisingly so in my opinion. But it was more than powerful enough to do what it set out to. It could represent any processes for algorithms it needed to. It predated the invention of physical elctronic computers as we know them by years. He coined the term \"algorithm\" for the actual first time in this work. In his aim to answer Hilbert's question, he proved that many problems were fundametally unsolvable by any possible algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this task, our turing machine will use the following elements: \n",
    "- A tape, usually divided into cells, each one contains a symbol from a set collection\n",
    "- A \"head\" that reads, writes or updates the symbols in cells\n",
    "- A register that stores current state from a set of available states\n",
    "- A transition system that decides what to do next based on current state and symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the states handling, we'll need to initialise our initial state that the computational process begins in, the acceptance state that tells us process has been succesful and a rejection state that tell us its failed or halted the computational process.\n",

    "This is a branch of Computer Science many would consider foundational. It studies resources like time and space required to solve different computational problems. It emerged in the 60s and 70s with the work of researchers like Richard Karp, Michael Rabin and Stephen Cook who at the time, established several structured frameworks that allowed for analysing algorithms and their efficiency. The field of Computational Complexity aims to tackle questions like \"How efficiently can we solve this problem?\" or \"What limitations does this algorithm have?\" - [*The complexity of theorem-proving procedures*.

As an example of how these systems are used, Bubble Sort (which we're about to implement) typically has a time complexity of O(n²) at the average to worst cases, but in the best cases scenario it'll manage O(n), but this is only when the array is already sorted. For space complexity, it has O(1) because it simply sorts in-place. - [*Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness*](http://www.csc.kth.se/~viggo/problemlist/compendium.html)"

    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is a well known algorithm across programming. For the unfamilliar, it works by stepping through a list of numbers or units repeatedly and comparing their adjacent elements, we then swap them if they're order is incorrect. Its name derives from the fact that elements slowly \"bubble\" to the top of the list as the iterations sort it. Bubble sort isn't always the most efficient choice for larger datasets, but I find its easily understandable and effective to implement. Its memory overhead is minimal enough and great for learning to understand sorting algorithms. - [*The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching*](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)"

    "### Array Traversal\n",
    "The first step to accomplishing a general implementation of bubble sort is the traversal process. We should always start at the very beginning of our array. We compare its one adjacent element (to the right). If our initial is greater than the second for example, they are swapped. "

    "As mentioned previously, Bubble Sort on average has a Time Complexity of O(n²), if we compare this against other sorting algorithms... its not ideal. Merge Sort for comparison is O(n log n), Quick Sort and selection sort are both O(n²) aswell at their worst, but they're not as stable as Bubble Sort. Our work here does highlight something pretty important which is worst and average cases vs best cases. While theoretically, our performance could be O(n) with Bubble Sort at its best, this is rarely the case and in actual practical scenarios, we cannot rely on it being the case. Using different examples above shows us how it behaves in different instances or degrees of sorted. The examples take a variety of passes to sort, varying quite a bit based on their input. - [*Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms* (3rd ed.). Pearson.
